is focused on creating a application
that takes 3 images out of an array of images, and randomly places the images side by side. 

presenting 3 images on the page. 
Each image should come from the array/directory

in addition the three images should all be unique images, no duplicates. when the user clicks on the Sumbit the user gets three new photos (no immediate repeating photos)

the user should be able to click on the images.

it should have a tracker for how many times the same image has been displayed. 



after 25 selections have been made, the listerns of the images turn off.
